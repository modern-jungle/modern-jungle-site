      Established in 2019, Modern Jungle is an online literary site which
      publishes modern fiction and creative nonfiction pieces from emerging
      writers. Our goal is to help new voices tell deeply personal,
      unconventional stories which shed light on their unique, human experience.

      Have some writing that you think fits our vibe? Send submissions to
      modernjunglepress@gmail.com for a chance to be featured on Modern Jungle.
      We review all submissions and will offer some feedback as well. We are not
      currently able to offer compensation other than internet fame for online
      submissions, although this could change in the future.
